## Notes from talking to Daniel
- definitely talk about all the stuff: we need to prove to that we have thought about everything 
(so talk about locks, etc). provide background to the ant simulator.
- he said something like "this is a different problem ... but i've thought about it, have conisdered possibilities"
- CUDA: talk about grid data structure and stuff. when i talked about CUDA (just explaining 3D grids 
and stuff and which loops we would optimise) he said "everything you just said, put it in the report"
- talk about determinism and how we solved it
- focus on optimisation though
- talk about rewrites required for optimisation
- video: just hit the major points, don't bother to explain stuff. include graphs, 
explain conclusions, if it didn't perform how we expected, explain why.
- skip over explaining the stuff in the beginning "like linking it back to ant colony optimisation"
- when a graph appears on screen, explain it! point out the colours, etc.
- can be casual with slides
- make sure graphs in video are in report
