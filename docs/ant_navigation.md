# Ant navigation
Problem: The ants move randomly, but they're not getting anywhere.

We will solve this problem in a "digital signal processing" sense. We have two signals:

- Signal: A steering vector to the closest food pixel
- Noise: A uniformly random steering vector generated by Xoshiro256** algorithm (so high quality
and fast)

So we will then we will devise a function that basically _mixes_ signal and noise depending on the
ant's distance to the closest food pixel. The idea is to never have exclusively noise or exclusively
data signal, always a mix of both.

x-axis: Normalised Chebyshev distance to the closest food pixel. Normalise it by taking the distance
along the diagonal (should be the max distance), and then doing `normalised = dist / max_dist`

y-axis: In the function, 0.0 means 100% noise, and 1.0 means 100% signal.
